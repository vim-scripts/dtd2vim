Script for creation XML data file for Vim7 XML omni-completion from DTDs
Requires: perl and perlSGML (tested against 1997Sep18 version)

INSTALLATION:

   Copy into your $PATH

USAGE:

   dtd2vim <file.dtd> [<dialectname>]

This command will create file <file.vim> (remove .dtd extension and add .vim;
other extensions will remain intact).

<dialectname> (not obligatory) will be part of dictionary name and will be
used as argument for :XMLns command (file name - sans extensions) have to be
the same.

perlSGML and this script doesn't work with multiple files. User has to
prepare single DTD file to parse all data.

In created file global variable is named g:xmldata_<dialectname>. When second
argument wasn't provided 'xxxx' will be used.
After that place file in:

   ~/.vim/autoload/xml

directory. Of course it can be also global directory or other Vim data
hierarchy of files. Example for  DocBook 4.4:
DTD is in file docbook.dtd, call command with

   dtd2vim.pl docbook.dtd docbook44

Put file as:
  
   ~/.vim/autoload/xml/docbook44.vim

 Omni-completion for DocBook 4.4 files will be started with:

   :XMLns docbook44

 command.
